/**
 * Rule reviews data layer.
 *
 * A RuleReview is the working copy an internal reviewer sees for one rule from
 * the out-of-the-box (OOTB) library:
 *
 * - Conditions belong to the rule and apply to every clause in it. A condition
 *   either tests clause set data (for example Contract Category) or the answer
 *   to a questionnaire question.
 * - Each clause carries its own prescription text and clause text, which are
 *   read-only during review.
 * - Each clause is either Included or Excluded by the rule.
 *
 * Reviews are built lazily from the rule list in `rule-approvals.ts` so the two
 * screens always agree on names, counts, and statuses. Text is sample content.
